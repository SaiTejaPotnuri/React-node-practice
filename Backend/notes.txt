Node js & Express

1. npm init -> to create package.json file
2. creating http connection
        const http = require("http");
3. Creating server :
        const server = http.createServer((req,res) =>{
            console.log("server is running");
            console.log(req.url," req method ",req.method);
            res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
            res.write("hello world");
            res.end();
        })

4. Listen client or user requests
        server.listen(3000)


NodeMon :   
    1. It is used for continuous running server even if you changed any code no need to stop the server and restart
    2. In package.json add code inside scripts like:
                    "start": "nodemon app.js"


Express :
    1. It is framework used in node js to roboust the code in web and mobile applications
    2. The initial setup of Express :
                const express = require("express");
                const app = express();
                const port = 3000;
                app.listen(port,() => console.log("server is running in port : ",port));

    3. Middlewares :
                1. Middleware in Node.js/Express is software that sits between
                    the server request and response to perform specific functions like authentication, logging, or data processing.
                2. middel ware is takes request from the user , each request from user takes one Middlewares
                3. Each middle ware looks that if one middleware takes time meanwhile other request with middleware will execute
                4. next() is a method that do execute the next middle ware if we not mention in firstmiddle ware it is not execte the next middleware

                5. Sample code :
                        app.post('/api/login',(req,res,next) =>{
                                console.log("login api called",req.url);
                                res.send("login api called");
                                next();
                        })
